         <h1 style="color:red;font-size:40px;">Marco</h1>      
         <p style="color:yellow;font-size:18px;">Howdy! My name is Marco Ramirez and I am a senior Technology Management major with minors in both Mathematics and Business! </p>
         <p style="color:yellow;font-size:18px;">I was born and raised in Corpus Christi, Texas, and my interest in technology really stems from my love for LEGOs! It has always been a dream of mine to visit LEGOLAND California, so maybe I will fulfill that promise to myself soon. </p>
         <p style="color:yellow;font-size:18px;">In my free time, I like to workout and play video games. The game I play religiously is Apex Legends. I have always been a fan of first person shooters since COD MW2 days, so having that aspect as well as differing character abilities is what I love about the game! Before the current pandemic, I would be a regular at the Rec playing pickup basketball. I am very competitive person by nature, so I cherish a good game of fundamental basketball. Pictured is my last notable victim of my killer crossover.  </p>

         <h1 style="color:green;font-size:40px;">Zach Keck</h1>      
         <p style="color:orange;font-size:18px;">Hey my name is Zach Keck, I am a senior here at Texas A&M University and I am majoring in Technology Management. I chose this major because of my interest in technlogy and the broadness of the field, I like how this major let's me choose a wide variety of jobs. A few things about me are that I love A&M, I like working out, and the outdoors. I have interests in just about everything so I am very open minded. I built a computer when I was 14 that I still use today. I wish graphics cards were not so expensive today. Thank you for reading a few things about me, down below is the picture of me.</p>

         <h1 style="color:blue;font-size:40px;">Alexander</h1>      
         <p style="color:white;font-size:18px;">My name is Alexander Forde. I was born and raised in Austin, TX. I am targeting my internship search for the Spring 2022 semester, hopefully staying within the Austin area. However, as a prospective graduate of the Technology Management program, I would be open to any of the Texas metropolitan areas since tech seems to cluster around the cities. I HATE A&M!!!!

I am most interested in the project management aspect of Technology Management. I recently took EHRD 477, which introduced me to basic project management approaches. It is a very exciting role to play in the technology industry and I hope to fully pursue it post graduation. Currently, I am focused on studying for my Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) exam. I believe earning the CAPM will be a solid short term career goal and will help direct me towards my long term goal of applying for the PMP certification.
         
A couple of fun facts about me are that I am a dual citizen. I hold both U.S. and Ireland passports. My family frequently travels between the two countries but we haven't done that much with the pandemic around. Also, I enjoy collecting vinyl records. Some of my favorite artists include David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Nicks, and Dusty Springfield.</p>
